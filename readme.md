## GoHangout
This is a visual chat application written in Go.

Requirements:
Please follow the reqirements section on the [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2#requirements) project for your operating system.

How to build:
``
go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/img
go build
``
If you properly set up the SDL2 dev libraries then you should now have an executable file in the project directory.
